        // 4. Possibly copying overflow into prebuffer (malloc/realloc, memcpy)

        // 1. Possibly resizing prebuffer (malloc/realloc)
        // 2. Filling buffer (read)
        // 3. Searching for term (memcmp)
        // 4. Copying underflow into packet buffer (malloc/realloc, memcpy)
        // 5. Removing underflow from prebuffer (memmove)
        //
        // Comparing the performance of the two we can see that reading
        // data into the prebuffer first is slower due to the extra memove.
        //
        // However:
        // The implementation of NSMutableData is open source via core foundation's CFMutableData.
        // Decreasing the length of a mutable data object doesn't cause a realloc.
        // In other words, the capacity of a mutable data object can grow, but doesn't shrink.
        //
        // This means the prebuffer will rarely need a realloc.
        // The packet buffer, on the other hand, may often need a realloc.
        // This is especially true if we are the buffer owner.
        // Furthermore, if we are constantly realloc'ing the packet buffer,
        // and then moving the overflow into the prebuffer,
        // then we're consistently over-allocating memory for each term read.
        // And now we get into a bit of a tradeoff between speed and memory utilization.
        //
        // The end result is that the two perform very similarly.
        // And we can answer the original question very simply by another means.
        //

        // then we do so. Otherwise we use the prebuffer.
